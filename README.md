# python-repository-template

A Python repository template to facilitate getting your projects started and organized.

In another shell:

# For run this project you only need to use those 2 commands

Anyone that clones your repository should be able to relatively easily run your code with just a few commands. The Makefile should contain the following commands:

```bash
make install
python main.py
```

#Esse ultimo comando tem que ser rodado dentro da pasta src/app
